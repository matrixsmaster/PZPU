/*
 * The Basic model:
 * 1. Run SDL window
 * 2. Start Box thread
 * 2.a. Box thread calls UpdateScreenBuffer() every it's own frame
 * 2.b. Box thread calls UpdateSoundBuffer() every time the buffer is ready
 * 2.c. Box thread calls QueryUIEvents() every time the thread ready to process them
 * 2.note. This mechanism is close enough to what will happen on a real chip
 * (video generator may be a separate chip, which connected to main chip via UART/SPI/I2C
 * or may be just a timer's interrupt handler; audio output controller may be implemented
 * as simple timer interrupt, which updates the other timer's values to change duty
 * cycle of PWM generated; keyboard handler is a pin change interrupt handler too;
 * all of this parts will never affect the main code)
