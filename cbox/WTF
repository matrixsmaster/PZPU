CBOX? WTF?!

It's simple. I've bored and exhausted by trying to port all this c/c++ mixed code to
low-end platforms. Situation with arm wasn't so horrible (but this still has an issue
of RAM size), but now I'm headed to avr8 and pic16 archs, where all of the c++
overhead and unpredictability makes my brain bleed out.
Moreover, Box-MT had to be a multi-thread (MT) version, consist of multiple isolated
(by conventional memory space) modules, and the whole system had to be linked via
shared external dynamic RAM. This bizarre configuration was invented to support even
low-costish silicon and truely make it possible to launch DOS (albeit slowly) on
pure homebrew (laser and iron made PCB, DIP packages of chips, easily solderable) PC.
I even have prepared PCBs (factory made) for this!

There were many test attempts to crush the code in order to force it to do what I want
to do :) None of them were committed to source control.

So, CBOX (cbox) is my next step to make my dream come true: kludge all the code to
make it pure C (ugly looking, maybe, but still pure C).
After this task will be accomplished, I can restore my box-mt, and only after
successfull testing, begin to port it to 8-bit MCUs.
A huge task... But my PCBs laying on my desk looks at me all the time, I can't resist!
