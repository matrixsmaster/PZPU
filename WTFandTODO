The main goal of this project is creation of embeddable version of
x86-compatible virtual machine, which may relatively easily run on something
really low-cost. Like cheap MCUs. It doesn't matter which chip you'll use!
Thanks to its double-layer abstraction, DOScard may even run on ATTiny85!
This is a fun weekend project, so don't expect anything really usable :)
But if you want to run your beloved old DOS software on a nice and small
totaly HOMEBREW "cardboard" PC (which will cost you around $15) -- feel
free to contribute and share the fun!
